You an also hit shift+enter to run the cell that is currently selected. There is no concurrency since cells run one at a time but you can queue up multiple cells\n",
        "- Each cell will run code individually but memory is shared across a notebook Runtime. You can think of a Runtime as a code session where everything you create and execute is temporarily stored. This means variables and functions are available between cells if you execute one cell before the other (physical ordering of cells does not matter). This also means that if you delete or change the name of something and re-execute the cell, the old data might still exist in the background. If things aren't making sense, you can always click Runtime -> restart runtime to start over.\n",
        "- Runtimes will persist for a short period of time so you are safe if you lose connection or refresh the page but Google will shutdown a runtime after enough time has past. Everything that was printed out will remain on the page even if the runtime is disconnected\n",
        "- Google's Runtimes come preinstalled with all the core python libraries (math, rand, time, etc) as well as common data analysis libraries (numpy, pandas, scikitlearn, matplotlib). Simply run `import numpy as np` in a code cell to make it available"

This initiative will aim to develop a predictive model that will identify whether an animal's condition is dangerous and if it is at risk of dying, drawing upon five distinct symptoms. The dataset for this project, sourced from Kaggle, will feature a diverse array of species ranging from birds to mammals, each characterized by symptoms such as fever, coughing, weight loss, pain, and more.\n",

To address the challenge of an unbalanced dataset, the Random Over Sampling method will be employed to achieve balance. Exploratory data analysis will uncover significant insights into the danger levels of the animals, which will inform decision-making for animal welfare and contribute to bio-heritage conservation.\n",
        "\n",

It assigns a unique integer to each label, allowing algorithms to work with numbers rather than text. For example, it might convert 'red' to 0, 'green' to 1, and 'blue' to 2. This process helps in preparing data for analysis and modeling, especially when dealing with algorithms that require numerical inputs."
